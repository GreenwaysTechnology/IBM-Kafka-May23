				Kafka fundamentals

What is kafka ? Apache Kafka

Kafka is a java program, written in java.

Kafka was originally developed at Linkedin, and later it was open sourced, 
Jay Kreps, Neha ,and juno Rao who created kafka.

If you want to understand kafka , just think about , How logs are working.

Log is just information about what happend in your system.
for instance, some warnings, some errors, some info,tracing.

Log information is recored in a file which is called log file.

How log works?
 log works based on the concept called append only, which is mere file io.
file io involves read and write something(data).

Writing data into file in two mode.

=>replace mode  
   data is written into file which will be replaced or edited later.
=>Append only mode
   data is written into file at end of every line just add entry at last line of file, which is called append only


Kafka is based on log, Kafka is just logger system.

Kafak is based on commit log.

What is commit log?
    In data management platforms, a commit is making of set of tenative changes permanent.
 making the end of a transaction and providing Durablity to ACID transactions.
The record of commits is called "commit log".

What Kafka is going to record into commit log?
   Kafka was desigend to capture informations(data) or events about system.
 What is happening in the software system, i want to record every thing.


What is event?
  something that happens, or happened.
An event records the fact that "something happened" in the world or in your biz, or in your life, around you.

eg:
  today stock avg price is 100$
  i met my friend yesterday at east coast road
  Made a payment of $500 to Ramesh

Imagine i need some body/something should record every activity of my life from early moring when i get up and till sleep.

 There is a system to record every events of your life that is called kafka.

Kafka is event recorder, Kafaka records events happened in the system.

Kafak is event processing software, which process events.

Events Types:
............
1.Past events - Happened
      Made a payment of $500 to Ramesh
2.present events - on going / on progress  events

Event Streams:
.............
Stream is nothing but  on going or on progress over period of time.
We can record on going events /on progress events into system


"An Event is any type of action or incident or chage that's idenfified or recorded by software or applications eg a payment, a website click or temperature reading, along with with a description of what happended"

"A event is a coimbination of notification", the element of when-ness that can be used to trigger some other activity and state.

"event contains two things"
 =>What happened - name of the event
 =>State - data


state:
.......
 The state is nothing data 

How generally data/state is stored?
   information is stored in database as table which represents the state of something
eg user- id,name,city

can we store events in databases?
 We cant  store all events in the database

Modern data modeling:
 Now a days instead of thingking "things(Customer,Order,Payment)" first, people starts thinking events first
 instead of stroing things into db, we store events.

events also has some state like "things"

"events has some description of what happened with it, but primary idea is that event is an indication in time that thing took place"
    
      "You cant store every events happened or happing in the system into db"

How do you store events?
  Logs - Log is structured and the sequence of the events occured in the method calls.

			  What is apache kafka?

Kafka is a software system for managining these logs using a fairly standard,the same historical term called "topics".

What is topic?
 Topic is logical structure to store events which is similar to database schema and database table

What is event according to kafka?

  Event is like key-value pair structure just like table row of data

Topic is logical structure which stores sequence of information
Topic is log of events.

Features of logics:
=>logs are easy to understand
=>logs are append only
=>logs are immutable
=>logs are highly durable=>By default all events are recorded into file system, there is no concept like non durable that is we never store data in memory.
=>Can only seek by offset, not indexed
.....................................................................................
			Kafka is highly Distributed
.....................................................................................
Traditionally, log processors are scalable or highly available.
Kafka is distributed log processing system, which is scals log data into multiple system.

			Kafak Distribution - Kafka setup
..................................................................................

Kafka distribution:
 Kafka is availble in two distribution

1.Apache Kafka
  It is opensource version of kafka
2.Confulent kafka
  It is abstraction of apache kafka , commerical version of Apache kafka

Apache Kafka vs Confulent kafka:
https://www.confluent.io/apache-kafka-vs-confluent/


Platforms:
1.bare metal 
 kafka is distributed for all os

1.windows : may be good for basic use cases
2.linux  : recommended for advanced use cases
3.mac : recommended for advanced use cases.

2.VM env
  you can setup kafka on any industry standard vms -  oracle virtual box

3.Container based distributed - docker and kubernets
    it is highly recommend for dev and also even in productions.
